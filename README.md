# Predictive-Modeling-of-School-Incidents
This project uses data analytics to predict and prevent classroom disruptions before they happen. By analyzing referral patterns, times, and contexts, it identifies when and where behavioral issues are likely (0 or 1 prediction). The goal is to reduce unnecessary referrals and maximize focused, disruption-free learning time.
